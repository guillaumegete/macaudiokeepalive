Optical/HDMI Audio Port Keepalive for MacOS

Do you use an optical audio cable to connect your mac and your amplifier? Do you experience one second silences in high fidelity music, lost words and lost sounds in movies? Well, it's not your nor your hardware's fault - it's an energy saving feature of the optical audio interface - the S/PDIF standard. And MacOS Audio Keepalive is the solution for you!!!

Mac Audio Keepalive generates an absolutely unhearable tone that prevents your optical audio output to shut down at short silences/musical breaks, so you can enjoy an uninterrupted hi-fi audio stream. Enjoy!
